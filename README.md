## Encryption_demo.cpp

- Compilation:
```
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall -I/usr/local/include/SEAL-4.1 -o encryption_demo encryption_demo.cpp -L/usr/local/lib -lseal-4.1
```



### NEXT HIGHEST IMPACT: Encrypted Directional Vector Analysis
   - Use GPS trajectory angle to determine toll direction
   - Homomorphic vector calculations for privacy-preserving direction detection
   - Solve overlapping toll zones (different directions)
